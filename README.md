## Kinetic Reactions for Biomass Pyrolysis
Various kinetic schemes are available to predict the devolatilization of biomass to gas, tar, and char products. The function files (`func_.py`) listed below are based on a particular kinetic scheme. Each function returns the product yield applicable to a particular scheme. See the comments in each file for more details. Different approaches of solving the system of kinetic reactions are also investigated in the `approach_.py` files.
