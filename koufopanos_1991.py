"""
Plot yields from primary and secondary reactions as determined by the
Koufopanos 1991 kinetic scheme for biomass pyrolysis. Note that this scheme
focuses on wood conversion and char yield. Product of volatiles and gas is
lumped together as (V+G) so individual tar and gas component is not provided.
